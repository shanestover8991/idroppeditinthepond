"I Dropped It in the Pond" is the title of an ethnographic reflection on the Reorganized Latter Day Saint (RLDS) movement. This ethnography will focus in particular on the idea of the Reorganization as a site of privilege and prestige. "I dropped it in the pond" is a specific comment one Graceland University alum made to me on Sacrament Sunday during a fun winter 2023-2024 visit to a local Reorganized congregation near where I lived in suburban Los Aangeles. There's lots of rules around privacy--in life in general, as well as in the act of ethnographic writing and thinking. His, her, or they/their name, and the name of the other person who sat next to me during that conversation, will remain anonymous for now. Let's just say, we had a lot of fun together on a very special Sunday, and even after many years of taking the sacrament in (non-Reorganized) Latter-day Saint congregations, that particular sacrament, and the conversation that ensued after it, are both events that I'll remember for a long time.

Reorganized Latter Day Saintism is, overall, a censored perspective on a censored book--the Book of Mormon. I thought I was a super amazing detective when, as a teenager, I discovered the Book of Mormon through an unexpected Valentine's Day encounter with a Young Women's President at a school dance. I hid a gold Barnes & Noble Book of Mormon (the one that Sheri Dew edited) [LINK] under my bed and read it every night after lacrosse practice, under the moonlight. It often opened to Alma 42 or 44 because of the way characteristics of the book's spine binding, and those chapters discuss the ideas of spirit paradise [LINK] and of sexual morality [LINK]. It was a thrill to attend Brigham Young University and immerse myself for years in many ideas that were totally censored in preppy Baltimore [LINK]. It was really challenging to discover--throughout my adulthood really, although particularly during my late 20s and early 30s, that the culturally-dominant perspective on and interpretation of the Book of Mormon are actually just one possible way of reading and thinking about the book. I spent a lot of time during the 2010s and 2020s being mentored by my "academic grandma," Linda King Newell, before she died. You know, Brigham Young forbade novels, and to this day, in Latter-day Saint religious culture, there's still a lot of cultural pressure to go into business or STEM fields rather than into the humanities. Although Linda's book, a biography of Emma Hale Smith, is a nonfiction book, I would encourage people to explore thinking about the book as, at minimum, creative nonfiction, if not downright an act of creative religious innovation, similar, although different from what it was like when Joseph Smith, Jr., wrote or translated the Book of Mormon. The St. George, Utah, congregation of Reorganized Latter Day Saintism does a lot of engagement with the idea of, like, sacred texts beyond the Christian Bible and Book of Mormon. "[CENSORED] Enigma: Emma Hale Smith" has definitely become like a spiritual guidebook for me. There's all kinds of gems and nuggets in there that help someone explore and understand both the Restoration and the Reorganization as much as one might possibly want to.

When you look at the Community of Christ website, or at the website for Graceland University, it doesn't look that impressive tbh -- not in comparison to all the opulent privilege and wealth you find in greater Utah, or at BYU, or in preppy Baltimore where I grew up. The premise and purpose of I Dropped It In the Pond is to express American Library Association values by fighting censorship in terms of helping people understand more about both the Restoration and the Reorganization--and the world beyond that, too--and to make informed choices about what books and other stuff guide our lives, and to understand that we have many, many, many choices. One of my mentors, Kristine Haglund, is the former editor of Dialogue: A Journal of [Latter-day Saint] Thought. She said something cool to me once: "If there's one thing I want Dialogue to accomplish, it's to help people understand that they have choices."

I choose, among other things, un-named Los Angeles Reorganized Latter Day Saint, to help tell your story, a little bit, and to add my story to it as well. I want the next Baltimore preppy who hides the Book of Mormon under his, her, or they/their bed, to really understand that they have a broader array of choices than they could possibly imagine.
